# StandardSirensVSQuasars

These python codes allow to reproduce the results shown in the paper ``Testing the Quasar Hubble Diagram with LISA Standard Sirens'' arXiv ---. The goal of this paper is to use Bayesian hypothesis testing to test with LISA standard sirens the deviation from the LCDM found by Risaliti and Lusso with quasars observations.
